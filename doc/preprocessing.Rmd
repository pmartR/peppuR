After creating an `as.MLinput()` object, the next phase in the peppuR pipeline involves common preprocessing steps such as:

1. Handling missing values
2. Correlation filtering
3. Near-zero variance filtering
4. Univariate feature selection

Since we have no missing data, we'll proceed into correlation filtering which utilizes Max Kuhn's `caret` package. In general we use a correlation matrix based approach with the peppuR function `univariate_feature_selection()`
```{r}
#single_source_peppuRobj <- univariate_feature_selection(single_source_peppuRobj)
```
